## Full App Enhancement (Phase 2 — Production System)

### Problems Solved
- ❌ Fake static data everywhere → ✅ All stats pulled from real backend SQLite sessions table
- ❌ Navigation exists visually only → ✅ Full drill-down: Filter → List → Live Session
- ❌ No workout session engine → ✅ Countdown + per-exercise timer + auto-advance + save
- ❌ Search is UI only → ✅ Working search filtering all 24 workouts + AI exercises
- ❌ No data architecture → ✅ `sessions` table with full session history, calories, duration

### New Backend Files
- `Backend/models/session.py` — SQLAlchemy `Session` model (title, exercises_completed, duration, calories, body_part, level, date)
- `Backend/routes/sessions.py` — `/sessions/save` (POST), `/sessions/history` (GET), `/sessions/stats` (GET)
- `frontend/app/api/sessions/route.js` — Next.js proxy for sessions endpoints

### Frontend Complete Rewrites
- **`frontend/screens/Training.js`** — Full production rewrite:
  - Real stats banner from backend (sessions count, calories, minutes)
  - Workout filter: body part (6 options) × mode (home/gym) × level (beginner/intermediate/advanced)
  - Exercise preview cards show before you start
  - "View Exercises" opens drill-down list with all exercises for selection
  - "Start Workout" → 5-second countdown ring → per-exercise 30-second timer → pulsing animation → rest timer → done summary
  - Session auto-saved to backend on completion (POST /api/sessions)
  - Stats cards refresh from real saved sessions
- **`frontend/screens/Discover.js`** — Full production rewrite:
  - 24 real categorized workouts, each with a full exercise list (reps, duration, calories, type)
  - Live search filters by title, description, category, and level
  - Category filter chips (All, Gym, Cardio, Yoga, Calisthenics, Martial Arts, Rehab, Bodyweight)
  - Clicking a card opens a full DETAIL PAGE (not a modal): hero image, stats grid, complete exercise list
  - "Start Workout" button on detail page triggers 5-second countdown → live session engine → save
  - Three-view state machine: browse → detail → session
  - Session saved to backend on completion; statistics update in real time
  - Empty state with clear guidance when no results found
- **`frontend/screens/Report.js`** — Full production rewrite:
  - All stats (sessions, calories, minutes) pulled from `/api/sessions?type=stats`
  - Recent Sessions list shows real saved sessions from backend (not hardcoded)
  - Weekly activity bar chart built from real session dates and calories
  - Empty state when no sessions have been completed yet
  - BMI calculator and weight tracking preserved and improved

### Mobile Enhancements
- `mobile/app/workout/session.tsx` — Added "countdown" phase before workout intro:
  - 5-second animated countdown screen with pulsing orange ring
  - "Skip Countdown" button for fast start
  - Auto-advances to workout intro after countdown completes

## Workout Session Flow (Full Interactive Engine)
Added complete end-to-end workout execution system:

### New Files
- **`mobile/store/useWorkoutStore.ts`** — Zustand global state store for workout plans, active sessions, completed sets, and persistent history
- **`mobile/app/workout/session.tsx`** — Full exercise flow screen with:
  - Intro phase: Shows full workout plan before starting
  - Exercise phase: Rep counter (auto + manual), play/pause, set indicator, AI feedback messages
  - Rest phase: 45-second countdown timer with skip option
  - Done phase: Trophy screen with total reps, calories, sets, and time
  - Persists data to AsyncStorage via Zustand
- **`mobile/app/workout/history.tsx`** — Full workout history screen with session summary, totals, and clear option

### Updated Files
- **`mobile/app/(tabs)/workout.tsx`** — Added "Start Full Workout" button after generating a plan; added "History" header link; wired to Zustand store
- **`mobile/app/(tabs)/stats.tsx`** — Connected real streak from AsyncStorage; shows workout history count from store; added "View History" card link
- **`mobile/app/_layout.tsx`** — Registered new `workout/session` and `workout/history` routes

### State Management Pattern
- `setCurrentPlan(plan)` → saves plan to Zustand
- `router.push("/workout/session")` → navigates to session
- Session screen reads `currentPlan` from store, starts workout, tracks sets
- `finishSession(duration)` → saves to AsyncStorage and resets active session
